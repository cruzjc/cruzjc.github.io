The concept of self driving cars are stirring up a hot debate on how they should be programmed. The topic is challenging the moral code individuals, groups of peoples, and humanity as a whole. It can draw roots deep down to questions asked long ago yet still have no answers. If one thing is obvious, it is that what is right and wrong mostly exist because of the existence of other people and their beliefs. This is an important thing to remember for a software engineer to remember if they were to program an autonomous vehicle.

From an individual perspective, all that a software engineer could hope for is to do their best. It is for them to maximize their capacity of moral insight and to reinforce their beliefs with whatever action as they see fit. It is *incredibly* hard for an average human to foresee the absolute potential their creation would have. In regards to self-driving cars, can an individual software developer ever fully account for all possibilities of moral question? Likely not. However what they can do is draw upon the opinions of others. If something were to happen that people could agree an outcome to, then the 'blame' could be shared. The software engineer programming a self-driving car could also just make the final decision themselves without consulting other people. At that point, the blame could be simply focused on themselves.

I do have my own opinions on how autonomous cars can be handled. One possible solution is to simply relinquish control to the driver. When faced with a scenario where a death is likely imminent, the driver/passenger should decide how to best handle the situation. Unless a conscious AI is driving, then it is still the responsibility of the driver/passenger to know what and how their vehicle is being governed.

Another perspective on how self-driving cars be handled is more on actively calling for laws/regulation on traffic. Pushing for limits/restrictions can offload more of the moral burden imposed on people programming cars that can determine life or death. It can allow for better expected parameters for programmers to work with rather than trying to account for extreme cases.
