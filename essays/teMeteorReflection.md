My first impressions as an application architecture are mixed. On one hand, I was trying to learn how to use this 'application architecture' in only a couple of weeks. On the other hand, as things come together the organization and handling of files started to seem more convenient. The past couple weeks absolutely felt like a 'meteor crash course'.

With all the 'required' readings and video tutorials that were tied into learning meteor, it felt that I possessed neither the time nor discipline to assimilate the knowledge. While watching a course teaching the basics of meteor, I honestly fell asleep halfway through. With all the readings, I would read maybe a paragraph or two, then save the rest for another time (at that rate it would have maybe taken a year to read all of them). I could make some sense from the course videos and readings, but it ultimately felt like information overload. However if there was one way I did learn most from, it is from simply following along with a tutorial. Of course there are videos that only give an abstract explanation, however, those are where I dozed off. Typing the exact same code, then hearing an explanation afterward is where I think I learned most from. Even if I didn't fully understand through the first pass, by the second or third repetition, it magically felt like I understood more content than what I have tried to read in meteor documentation. Even with the surprise usage of handlebars, flow routers, and local/server mongo databases, the experience was something where I could at least attempt to identify what I could change, and see the updated result. At the very heart of all this, it was that old 'monkey see, monkey do' process. And it worked (at least for me).

Part of what made meteor 'overloading' is learning why things are organized that way that they are. It initially felt that everything could have just been done with just HTML knowledge rather than all those other stuff {{like handle bars}}. It also felt overwhelming to comprehend all the directories. However afterward as I learn how this are referencing one another, it starts to slowly make sense, especially as a project size grows. "This needs this, so we import this, this needs references from this, so we connect this". It became an experience where I would just follow the bread crumbs and learned from that. It especially helped to have a template to learn from. Eventually, it started to look like things will neatly fit in their own spot, which is something I didn't really notice at first when learning meteor.

It was a weird and mixed experience. I would usually think it would take months to learn something like this and come up with anything.
 But all it took was maybe a day's worth of repeating what I see to learn something which surprises me.
