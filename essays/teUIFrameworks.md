The term ‘framework’ is relatively new to me, yet it is about a concept I already am familiar with. While learning Semantic-UI, it was a relatively straight forward experience with little or no headache. However, I should probably credit my past experiences with more strict computer language as a help towards learning a new UI Framework. Although learning a new framework does carry some amount of concern.

While going through ‘Information and computer science’ (Ics) classes at UH Manoa, one persistent worry is learning different computer languages. I would be concerned about learning about one language like java (ics111), then learn another like c/c++ (ics212) only to forget how to program in Java afterwards. It would take only months, maybe even weeks to forget and lose any sort of proficiency in a computer language. I would forget how to simply output a simple string, or forget the basic libraries associated to a certain language. I would worry about not being an expert at a language. Now, there are these ‘frameworks’. I guess it is like a smaller custom library in a language, but my worries and concerns about learning something new persists. 

Surprisingly however, coming up with something using Semantic-UI was not so hard. It was easy to learn by example code, and easy to implement. Aside from a minor problem (There were div’s everywhere, so I occasionally lose track), using Semantic-UI did feel close to a natural ‘semantic’ language. I thought it was pretty user friendly to just use descriptors when defining classes (eg, <div class=”ui container”>). A possible reason why I may not have had a hard time with Semantic-UI is probably because of my strict upbringings when learning C++;

There was this saying of some sort, all programmers are lazy. One of the first things I do while coding is to create my own ‘shortcuts’. In java for example, I would have it output something with just “d.o(variable)” rather than “System.out.println(variable)”. Because of this, I understand a little bit more of why these ‘frameworks’ exists. Just as I feel my ‘shortcuts’ save me time, these frameworks (like Semantic-UI) are obviously created to save time.

When it comes to learning something new about computers I do bare some concern, but recently I am discovering that more important ‘patterns’ will stick out more. Commonalities between computer languages stick out. Consistent and fluid logic is a recurrent theme.  Coding structure and personal preference of abstraction will persist. Even if I forget the details, learning how to use a new library or framework gets easier and faster over time.
