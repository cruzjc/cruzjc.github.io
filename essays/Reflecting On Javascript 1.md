My experience learning javascript felt a little “uneasy”. I am coming from a background of learning java, C and C++. I am currently formally learning C in another concurrent course, informally learned the basics of C++ from free online resources, and took another class on java in the past. Then when I learned the basics of javascript, it blew some of my expectations about learning a computer language away.

I didn’t expect that my knowledge of other computer languages to translate so easily into javascript. I first learned C++ and when I had a formal class about Java, I remember constantly being worried about remembering different libraries. In java there is the importing and in C there is also using namespaces. For javascript, there was a homework assignment where we had to go through 100 modules of learning javascript. I was frantically trying to finish it the night before it was due. However, it didn’t even dawn on me that I had not need to import anything. I did not even have to worry about a main function like in C or java. I just began to code. Only now it occurred to me just how ridiculously simple it is. Though the simplicity felt like something was lost.

My initial impression when I learned about defining variables in javascript was that this felt like an elementary computer language. I had this odd feeling that too much functionality was lost, that javascript is “weaker” and that I probably should’ve learned this language first. When I learned about arrays and how that worked in javascript, it only supplemented this feeling. I’ve only just recently learned about how linked lists worked with certain datatypes, and now javascript handles it like it is nothing! 

This is probably some personal bias of mine for having the feeling that javascript is “weaker”, but I can see how the ease of use can allow programmers to focus on the bigger picture of things. There are obvious trade-offs for the simplicity and more freedom to think abstractly, but right now the full “power” of javascript is left for me to experience on my own. Just as I have learned about the concept and useful nature of object oriented programming, learning the true potential of javascript is going to require actual practice. Only then may these initial impressions may either be validated or dismissed.
