	While working on my Undertale tile puzzle game there was one consistent problem that slowed down the overall design and management of the game, and it is simply the handling of files. It was only myself and a partner working on the game for a class project however tracking the changes between files was incredibly tedious and filled with assumptions. Reflecting back, it would have been remarkably handy if some form of configuration management was used.


I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.


I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
