	Taking a crash course into learning meteor in my opinion is a weird experience. It removes the open-ended freedom of being able to create or solve a problem then learning through that process, but instead replaces it with a ‘mechanical’ feel of a learning experience. I did learn something by simply following along with a ‘guide’ but I obviously ran into problems consistently. 
	One theme I have noticed throughout this ongoing learning experience is following the breadcrumbs. As part of what helped me learned at least some of the content needed to learn meteor is observing the references made throughout the entire project. All the imports, variable names, template names, etc became obvious to me how they connect. I’ve never even heard of handlebars before but it was a seamless experience on using it simply because of seeing the familiarities. My previous knowledge of semantic ui and Java script then started to ‘fit-in’ on how it could be used in conjunction with meteor to create an app. One consistent problem that I ran into though is unfortunately side effect with the use of all these references.
	It feels ironic, but the one aspect where I learn most is also what slows me down the most. It is the part where I forget to update any sort of references that are needed to get the app to run. It may just be me, but it is a slow process of revisiting all the files that were edited and making sure that everything connects. Perfectly. This process is hindered even more so when my natural tendency for typos and/or laziness presents itself.
	I think I learn most by doing. Not by reading a bunch of how to manuals but rather following along. It has been a slow process for me so far but it is better than the absolute lack of reading I have done.
