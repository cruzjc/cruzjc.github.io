One aspect about coding I enjoy is the freedom to approach a problem in a unique way. The habits formed and techniques used are unique to coders. In my view, it is like a signature. Another part of coding I appreciate is the unique experience from learning from mistakes. It may take a while to learn (even if it is a mistake in the making) but I think there are reasons to stay ignorant. With the introduction and enforcement to coding styles, it feels like some form of tyranny.

As expected, I formed a lot of coding habits. Among them is trying to minimally use spaces within my code. My reasons behind this preference is partly to fit more code within the screen. Another reason is to minimize keystrokes. The enforcement of a new coding style along with an innate habit to clean up code has resulted in an extended amount of time to complete code. My coding times seemed to have tripled since the enforcement of coding styles.

It may sound silly but finding problems is something I don’t mind spending time on. Even if those problems were of my own doing. Formatting and coding errors may end up taking a lot of time however in my view it is one of those ‘artificial pleasures’. It is similar to being able to solve a riddle or puzzle (like a crossword or thought experiment). If someone were to just give you the algorithm or unquestioned answers it would make things feel a little less pointless.

When facing the sight of ‘problems’ in one’s code which were formed by their own preference, it felt disheartening, and tedious. It felt as if the idea of freedom was shackled, citing security and efficiency. Rather a green checkmark of confident approval, twas instead a red mark of incessant nagging. Albeit there is a silver lining of being able to accomplish unimaginably more. To do bigger projects likely requires a team. And for a team to function nicely, a standard seems necessary. A coding style. After dealing with this ‘coding style’ hurdle hopefully there is more freedom.
