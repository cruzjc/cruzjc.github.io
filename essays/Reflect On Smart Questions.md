Time is always important and asking questions is a way to prevent wasting time. However, asking the wrong questions may end up wasting more of your time. There are ‘smart’ questions and ‘not so smart’ questions. There are questions which may be answered thoughtfully and leave you more educated than before. There are also questions which will be left eternally unanswered, buried underneath countless other pleas for help. When it comes to software engineering, asking the wrong questions and waiting for a response will ultimately result in a waste of time for the person asking and for anyone who bothers to read or attempt to answer the question.

When we ask questions, we are asking for help. Just as in the well-known fable ‘The boy who cried wolf’, asking for help is also asking for trust from others. This trust can be broken almost immediately and cost credibility in competence and stature. 

Asking the ‘not so smart questions’ can be frustrating for everyone. These kinds of questions include asking something that already was answered. Duplicate questions show that the author has not done any effort to look for answers and in return raises the question of why anyone should help the author. The idea of helping someone who can’t help themselves is already questionable. In my opinion, part of practicing good software engineering is being able to solve some problems independently, just like any other ‘engineer’. What also makes a question ‘not so smart’ is lack of clarity. A question where it is open to interpretation wastes time in being able to decipher what was asked and what is being asked. Broad and ambiguous questions might as well be asking the entire community to do ones work. Asking questions like “how would I sort this data” would likely be met with an equally half-hearted answer like ‘use quick-sort’.  Again, the question asked will reflect one’s level of knowledge and how much effort was put forward. 

The ‘smart’ questions require more effort, though this extra effort are absolutely worthwhile. These types of questions are unique and clear in what the author is trying to request. It would be obvious that the person has put sincere effort into research before venturing out into the community for answers. Maybe referencing other similar posts or other websites as past attempts would indicate at least some effort. One other important factor when asking a question other the uniqueness is being able to make a clear request as well as provide relevant information. It will help mentioning what was attempted.

In conclusion putting in some effort on finding answers to possibly already asked questions can save time. Also when asking questions, it would save time for everyone if thought was put into the question first.
