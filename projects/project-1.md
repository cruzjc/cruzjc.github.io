The Undertale Tile Puzzle is an Ics111 group project created using Eclipse and a multimedia library (EZ graphics by Dylan Kobayashi). This was based on a game me and my partner both enjoyed named Undertale.
The simple goal is to reach the other size of the randomly generated tile puzzle while avoiding tile hazards and dodging monsters.

I had a lot of fun while working on this game along with my partner primarily because I had motivation to learn anything about java to do what I wanted it to do. I am particulary proud of getting multiple threads to run even if it wasn't part of the curriculum nor part of improving the gameplay experience. It isn't as polished as I would like it to be mainly because it was a frantic coding jam before the deadline to a more meaty gameplay (adding in more monsters/classes and programming specific "bullet" patterns) but it was an experience that I learned a lot from.
