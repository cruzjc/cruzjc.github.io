In part of my spare time I have taken an interest in learning how to use the unreal engine. I came across a tutorial on the basics of the unreal engine and as a part of the learning process, it involved also learning the basics of C++ through visual studio. What resulted is a small text console game where you try to guess an isogram.

Going through this gave me some practice on the C++ language. I've tried learning C++ before on my own however the idea of pointers always gave me a headache. I think I have a better understanding now since I have written some code that make some use of it.
