# About Myself
Born and raised in Hawaii, I attended Leeward community college for an associates degree and afterwards, the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Professionally, I basically worked as IT support both during and after college. In my own time, I've also done some side programming projects, mostly in the Unity game engine. When I'm slacking off at home I enjoy enjoy the usual non-productive things other people have, like watching shows/movies, and playing games. Other times, I'm learning new stuff through online videos or working on miscellaneous stuff like this website.
